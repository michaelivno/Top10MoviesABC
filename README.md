## Overview

This project aims to provide a seamless experience for managing and viewing a list of top 10 movies. It allows users to add new movies, update existing ones, and view details of each movie in a stylish and elegant interface. The list is dynamically sorted based on movie rankings, ensuring only the top 10 movies are displayed at any time. (P.S. It‚Äôs pretty cool!)

## Features

### Front-end
- Built with React and Material-UI for a modern, responsive interface.
- Stylish header and list views with elegant gradients and shadows.

- Form for adding and editing movies with validation and error handling.

### Back-end
- Built with ASP.NET Core 8 and SQLite for simplicity and efficiency.
- Dapper for data access ‚Äì because who needs the overhead, right?
